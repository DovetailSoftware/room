# ROOM

ROOM is a Clarify Classic Client add-on product used to display Recently Opened Objects.
The product is called the Recently Opened Objects Monitor (ROOM).

It is often the case that Clarify users open up objects, close them, and then want to re-open them easily and
quickly. Suppose, for example, that a case is found by executing a case query. After the case is closed, the
user realizes that they need to look at the case again. If they don’t remember the case number, they have to
execute the query again to find the case.

Many programs provide a mechanism to retrieve recently opened objects. For example, in MS Word, you
can find recently opened documents via the File menu. The ROOM utility provides similar functionality for
Clarify.

ROOM allows users to view up to 100 recently opened objects. Objects that can be stored and reopened
from the GUI are Case, Subcase, Quote, Contract, Opportunity, Site, Contact, Part, Site Part, Solution,
Change Request, Part Request, Part Number, and Action Item. Users can choose which objects ROOM
remembers. Re-opening any recently opened object is easy. Just double click on it in the ROOM form, and
it will be opened.

ROOM also remembers objects between Clarify sessions. If you have a set of recently opened objects, and
leave Clarify, they will be available for you when you restart Clarify.

ROOM provides one new form – the Recent Objects form. This form can be opened from a new menu
item in the desktop menu.. Once the form is opened, just use Clarify normally. Each time an object is
opened, ROOM adds it to the list.

Note: If you don’t have the ROOM form opened, objects will not be added to the list.
If you open an object that is already on the ROOM list, the object is moved back to the top of the list.
